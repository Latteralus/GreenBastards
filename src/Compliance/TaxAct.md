(3) The Department of Commerce will have the following non-exhaustive powers in relation to regulating financial institution tax obligations:

(a) Audit and Inspection Authority. The Department shall have the authority to conduct regular audits and inspections of the financial records of deposit-taking financial institutions. This includes verifying the accuracy of reported profits and confirming legal compliance.
(b) Exemption Verification. The Department may verify the eligibility of deposit-taking financial institutions for taxation exemptions as outlined in Section 5. This includes assessing whether institutions meet the necessary requirements and, if necessary, revoking exemptions for non-compliance.
(c) Enforcement of Taxation. The Department is empowered to enforce the taxation provisions outlined in Section 7. This involves assessing, collecting, and overseeing the proper payment of monthly taxes by deposit-taking financial institutions.
(d) Investigation of Misrepresentation. In cases where misrepresentation of profits is suspected, the Department has the authority to conduct thorough investigations into the financial records of deposit-taking financial institutions. If intentional misrepresentation is confirmed, the Department may take legal action, including prosecution.

(3) The Department of Commerce will have the following non-exhaustive general powers in relation to regulating financial institutions:

(a) Registration: The Department of Commerce will have the power to assess an institution's eligibility, financial viability, and compliance with regulatory requirements prior to registration as a financial institution.
(b) Deregistration: The Department of Commerce will have the power to deregister financial institutions. This authority is granted to address instances of persistent non-compliance with regulations and or laws. Investigatory and legal due diligence, the best interests of the depositors, and restraint must be considered and applied in exercising deregistration.
(c) Commandeer: In extraordinary situations, the Department of Commerce has the power to commandeer and take temporary control of a financial institution. This authority is reserved for exceptional circumstances, such as insolvency, near insolvency, financial crises, or situations where the institution's continued operation poses a systemic risk to the financial system or depositors.
(i) The DOC reserves the right to refuse to declare any seized, commandeered, or nationalised institution as bankrupt under the Business Structuring Act or any subsequent acts. The DOC may retroactively declare the bankruptcy status of any seized, commandeered, or nationalised institution as void.
(d) Seizure and Sale. The Department of Commerce may consider commercial remedies such as selling a collapsed financial institution (or parts of a collapsed financial institution) to other interested financial institutions/parties. This may only take place when it is in the best interests of the depositors. Additionally, the Department may seize the assets of Directors of the Financial Institutions (with the least required disturbance to their estate) to recover debts.

(5) Once s9(2)(c) has been exhausted, the DOC is pre-authorised to use unappropriated Government funds to satisfy the payment of the Deposit Guarantee to impacted depositors.

(b) The Department of Commerce needs to have a reasonable justification for accessing the data it is requesting (this justification does not have to be shared with the Financial Institution).
(2) The Department of Commerce can only compel a Financial Institution to produce information in the course of its official duties.
(3) The Department of Commerce must treat the data of Financial Institutions as commercial-in-confidence, with the sole exception to this being the usage of strictly necessary data in a public report, and only to the extent required to describe and justify the reasoning behind any regulatory or enforcement action performed by the Department, including those listed in §8 of this Act.
