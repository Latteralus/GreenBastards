Audit Findings & Financial Logic ReviewDate: February 23, 2026Subject: DemocracyCraft Accounting Audit — Green Bastards Brewery1. The Loan Inconsistency (Major Finding)Issue: Looking at the Ledger (image_c5c8b8.png) vs. the Balance Sheet (image_c5cbdf.png), there is a disconnect in how loan proceeds were handled.The Ledger: Shows two "Loan Proceeds" of $11,000.00 each (Total $22k).The Balance Sheet: Correctly shows $22,000.00 under Liabilities.The Problem: Your Cash (Treasury) is $26,280.00. If you started with $2,300 (Founder Capital) and $4,100 (Investment), and then added $22,000 in loans, your cash should be $28,400 (assuming zero expenses). The current Treasury balance suggests $2,120 is "missing" or was eaten by a hidden transaction.Correction: Ensure that when a Loan is "Approved," the system triggers a Debit to Cash and a Credit to Loans Payable simultaneously.2. Inventory Asset LogicIssue: You requested all inventory be shown as assets.Observation: The Income Statement (image_c5cba7.png) currently shows $0.00 for COGS. This is actually correct under your requested logic if you haven't sold anything yet.The Audit Rule: In your system, buying ingredients (Hops/Malt) should not be an expense on the Income Statement at the time of purchase. It should be an Asset Exchange: Cash Decrease -> Inventory Increase. The "Expense" only hits the Income Statement as COGS when the beer is actually sold.3. The "Equity" MismatchIssue: The Balance Sheet (image_c5cbdf.png) shows Retained Earnings of $6,400.00.The Root Cause: This matches your "Investment / Other Income" on the Income Statement. In standard accounting, an owner's investment is Capital, not Income.The Fix: The $6,400 (which appears to be the $2,300 Capital + $4,100 Investment from the ledger) should be moved entirely to the Owner's Equity section as "Contributed Capital."Impact: Your Net Income should actually be $0.00 right now (since you haven't sold beer yet), and your Total Equity should remain $8,700 via contributions.Updated Financial Statements (Audited)Based on the provided images and your specific rules, here is the corrected state of the brewery as of Feb 23, 2026.Corrected Balance SheetASSETSLIABILITIES & EQUITYCash (Treasury)$26,280.00Loans Payable$22,000.00Savings Account$4,420.00Total Liabilities$22,000.00Inventory (at cost)$0.00Equipment$0.00Founder Capital$8,700.00Retained Earnings$0.00TOTAL ASSETS$30,700.00TOTAL LIAB. & EQUITY$30,700.00Corrected Income StatementCategoryAmountSales Revenue$0.00Total Revenue$0.00Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)$0.00Gross Profit$0.00Operating Expenses (Rent, Tax, Misc)$0.00NET INCOME$0.00Required Logic Adjustments for your SystemReclassify "Investment" Transactions: Ensure the ledger tags for "Investment" and "Capital Contribution" both point to Equity on the Balance Sheet, not Income on the Income Statement. This prevents your profit from looking artificially high.Automated Loan Entry: Update the "Approve" function for Loans.If Status == "Approved" AND Type == "Loan"Action: Add Principal to "Loan Liability" AND Add Amount to "Treasury Balance".Inventory Purchase Flow: * When you buy $500 of Hops:Treasury -$500Inventory Asset +$500(No change to Income Statement until the Hops are sold as beer).
